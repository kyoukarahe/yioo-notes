# Yioo Notes Progress

Date started: 2026-06-26

This file is the running implementation log for `yioo-notes`. Update it at the
start and end of every phase so state survives context changes, agent handoffs,
and deployment interruptions.

## Current Status

Phase: 1. Blog scaffold
Status: in-progress
Last safe state: Phase 0 planning documents were committed and pushed to
`origin/main`; Phase 1 source scaffold files have been added locally, with no
runtime AWS or application changes.
Next step: Install dependencies, build, verify `dist/notes/index.html`, and run
local preview route checks.

## Phase Log

### Phase 0. Baseline

Status: verified
Started: 2026-06-26
Finished: 2026-06-26
Scope: Confirm current repo/AWS/live-route assumptions and create the initial
implementation plan.
Files changed:

- `docs/notes-implementation-plan.md`
- `docs/progress.md`
- `docs/findings.md`

Commands run:

- `git status`
- AWS/S3/CloudFront inspection commands from the planning session
- Live route checks for `https://yioo.link/`, `https://yioo.link/tools/`, and
  related notes assumptions

Verification:

- `yioo-notes` is a fresh clone of `kyoukarahe/yioo-notes`.
- `yioo-notes` S3 bucket exists in `ap-northeast-1`.
- Main CloudFront distribution is `EWYEJXEIKC81C`.
- No `/notes` CloudFront behavior exists yet.
- No runtime notes deployment has been made yet.

Commit: `0a633a9` (`docs: add notes implementation plan`)
Push: Success to `origin/main` after explicitly using the `yioo-notes` deploy
key.
Deployment/invalidation: none
Rollback state: No runtime rollback needed; docs-only state.
Next step: Start Phase 1 blog scaffold.

Errors encountered:

| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell parser rejected `&&` command chaining. | Tried to run `git add`, cached diff, and diff check in one command. | Re-run the commands separately and avoid shell chaining. |
| Default SSH identity could not push to GitHub. | Ran `git push -u origin main`. | Re-ran push with `core.sshCommand` pointing to the registered `yioo-notes` deploy key. |

### Phase 1. Blog scaffold

Status: in-progress
Started: 2026-06-26
Finished:
Scope: Create the static generator scaffold, `/notes/` route, layout/content
folders, site config, and local build verification script.
Files changed:

- `.gitignore`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `astro.config.mjs`
- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `content/posts/.gitkeep`
- `content/drafts/.gitkeep`
- `content/private/.gitkeep`
- `src/config/site.config.json`
- `src/lib/posts.ts`
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
- `src/components/PostList.astro`
- `src/pages/notes/index.astro`
- `src/pages/notes/[slug]/index.astro`
- `src/styles/global.css`
- `scripts/verify-build.mjs`
- `docs/progress.md`

Commands run:

- `node --version`
- `npm.cmd --version`
- `npm.cmd install`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `npm.cmd run verify:build`
- `npm.cmd run preview -- --port 4321`
- `curl.exe -I http://127.0.0.1:4321/notes/`
- `curl.exe -I http://127.0.0.1:4321/notes`
- `npm.cmd run check`

Verification:

- Build succeeded and generated `dist/notes/index.html`.
- `npm.cmd run verify:build` confirmed `dist/notes` exists and draft/private
  output is absent.
- Local preview returned `200` for `/notes/`.
- Local preview returned `404` for `/notes`; this remains a later CloudFront
  exact route redirect concern, not a Phase 1 blocker.
- `npm.cmd run check` initially failed on missing Node type definitions,
  optional `tags` typing, and an Astro inline script hint; fixes are in progress.

Commit:
Push:
Deployment/invalidation: none
Rollback state: Revert the Phase 1 scaffold commit before any deploy.
Next step: Run dependency installation, build, and local route checks.

Errors encountered:

| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `astro check` failed because Node globals/modules had no type definitions. | Ran `npm.cmd run check`. | Added `@types/node` as a dev dependency. |
| `astro check` treated `post.tags` as possibly undefined. | Ran `npm.cmd run check`. | Made the normalized `Post.tags` field required. |
| Astro hinted that the analytics loader script should be explicitly inline. | Ran `npm.cmd run check`. | Added `is:inline` to the external analytics loader script tag. |
